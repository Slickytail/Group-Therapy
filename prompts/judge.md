[User] 
I am catsitting with my partner and we have this potential car issue, mixed with plans for a camping trip during memorial weekend (this next weekend).
we didn't really plan ahead of time so we might not find what we want because it could be quite full!

I see, you're definitely in a situation where you're juggling a lot of responsibilities and plans: car costs, favors for friends, and planning your own activities. I'm sure that these are causing you a lot of stress!

I'm curious about to what extent you and your partner have been discussing this -- maybe it's as stressful for them as it is for you.
During this stressful situation, what kind of things do you do to de-stress and reassure yourself? Thoughts, coping mechanisms...?

(Therapist 1)
Yes, it can be hard to find things to book when you're too late. Have you considered planning ahead next time?

(Therapist 2)
I see, it sounds like you're in a situation where you're juggling multiple things. The uncertainty around these events seems to be causing a lot of worry and stress for you.

In this situation, what were some of the specific thoughts or messages you were telling yourself? I need to understand you.

(Therapist 3)

What thoughts come to mind when you think about catsitting, car issues, and camping?
